--- abstract

TLS session tickets are generated by servers and issued to clients for stateless
resumption. Moreover, servers often distribute a single ticket to clients. Clients
should only use tickets once, especially if tickets are used to protect early application
data in TLS 1.3 and related protocols. However, single tickets limit a client's ability 
to perform connection racing, as multiple competing connections should not re-use the same
ticket more than once. This document describes a mechanism that enables the clients to 
request multiple TLS session tickets from the server so as to enable such features.
